# test_duplicates

This directory contains **unit tests** (and supporting scripts) for detecting and handling duplicate code segments and duplicate files within the project for the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} _Low‑Level Programming_ repository.

## 📂 Directory Structure

test_duplicates/
├── [test files...]
└── README.md ← this file

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

The purpose of this test suite is to ensure code quality and maintainability by:

- Identifying **duplicate code blocks** across files so they can be refactored or removed.
- Detecting **duplicate files** (e.g., same content under different names) that may cause maintenance confusion.
- Ensuring that the repository does not accumulate redundant code, which can lead to bugs or inconsistencies.

This helps keep the codebase clean, easy to review, and easier to extend.

## ✅ How to run the tests

1. Navigate to the `test_duplicates` directory:
   ```bash
   cd test_duplicates
Run the test runner or script. For example:

bash
Copy code
./run_tests.sh
or (if using Python):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m unittest
Replace with the actual command you support in this directory.

Review the test output. Any reported duplicate blocks or files should be resolved (either by consolidation, removal or proper refactor).

📌 Interpreting Results
Duplicates found: The output will specify file paths and line or block ranges of duplicated code.

No duplicates: Good — the code is clean according to this test suite.

For each detected duplication, consider:

Can the code be refactored into a common function or module?

Can one of the duplicate files be removed, or merged into the other?

Does duplication make tests or maintenance harder? If yes, remove it.

🧩 Maintenance & Best Practices
Run this test suite regularly, especially before merging large features or reorganizing modules.

When adding new code, consider: “Will this logic be reused elsewhere?” If yes, place it in a shared module rather than duplicating.

Keep code DRY (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”). Duplication often leads to divergence and bugs.

If the code must be duplicated (for performance, clarity, or other constraints), add a comment explaining why the duplication is intentional and safe.

🛠️ Environment & Requirements
Language: C (or mixture of C and shell scripts) — consistent with the Holberton Low‑Level Programming curriculum.

Testing tools: any custom scripts provided in this directory.

Compatibility: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or equivalent), with a standard toolchain (gcc, make, shell).

Coding style: All code under test should follow the Holberton coding style (e.g., using the Betty linter, if applicable).

🔍 What’s NOT Covered
This directory focuses only on duplication detection — it does not test program correctness, memory leaks, performance, or style violations. Those are handled elsewhere in the repository.

It does not automatically refactor duplicates — human judgment is required to decide how to resolve reported duplicates.

🎓 Why It Matters
Duplication in low‑level code (C, pointers, memory management) can be especially hazardous because:

It can hide subtle bugs (two almost‑identical functions drift apart).

It makes maintenance harder — every fix must be replicated in each duplicate.

It bloats the codebase and reduces readability.

By proactively testing for duplication, you keep the code lean, robust, and easier to teach/learn — which aligns with the goals of the Holberton curriculum.
