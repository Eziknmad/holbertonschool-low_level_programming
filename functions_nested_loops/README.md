# Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains C programming exercises focused on mastering the use of **functions** and **nested loops**. These tasks are designed to help you understand how to implement repetitive tasks using loops within functions, following the Holberton School's coding standards.

## What you'll find here

- Functions that perform operations involving loops, such as printing sequences of numbers, time tables, and formatted outputs.
- Tasks that reinforce how to write clean, efficient C code using nested loops.
- Strict adherence to the **Betty** style guidelines for code formatting and readability.
- Source files (`*.c`) implementing each function.
- Header file (`main.h`) containing all function prototypes.
- Main files (`*-main.c`) to test and demonstrate each function.

## Key concepts practiced

- Writing functions that use loops effectively.
- Nested loops to handle multi-level repetition.
- Proper code formatting and style compliance.
- Compiling multi-file projects with headers and source files.

## Examples of tasks included

- Printing the last digit of a number.
- Printing every minute of a day in HH:MM format.
- Displaying the 9 times multiplication table.
- Adding two integers.
- Printing natural numbers from any number to 98.
